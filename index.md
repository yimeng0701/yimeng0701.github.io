## About Me

I am currently an NLP researcher at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab in Hong Kong SAR. Before this, I worked at Huawei Canada Research Centre for 3 years. My work involves building pre-trained models for customers and conducting research related to model compression.

I completed my Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from McGill University in 2019, under the supervision of Dr. Ioannis Psaromiligkos. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering from Tianjin University in 2017.
